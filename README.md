<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [Screen Shot][product-screenshot] -->

Have you ever spent hours looking for the name of a method or property of a third party library? You are sure that this method/property must exist, but you cannot find it, neither in the documentation, nor in the examples, nor on StackOverflow... You end up scrolling through the source code of the library... So frustrating!

Search'In is a tool that allows you to search in python objects as if you were on Google, just by adding a line in the middle of your code !

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Using Search'In requires no effort at all!

Install Search'In with pip :
```sh
pip install searchin
```

Import Search'In in your code, by adding this line :
```python
import searchin
```

To search for `"name"` in a `Human` class for example, just add this line :
```python
searchin(Human, "name")
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Other examples
You can search for any string in any python "entity" : variable, method, object, class, module, etc.

**Search for `"5"` in a `tuple`**
```python
searchin((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), "5")
# >>> "5" found in root.4 : 5
```

**Search for `"mean"` in the method `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`**
```python
searchin(torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy, "mean")
# >>> "mean" found in root. : def cross_entropy( [...] reduction: str = "mean", [...], label_smoothing)
```

**Search for `"grad"` in a `torch.nn.Module`**
```python
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10)
searchin(model, "grad")
# >>> "grad" found in root.bias
# >>> "grad" found in root.requires_grad_
# >>> "grad" found in root.weight
# >>> "grad" found in root.zero_grad
```

## Advanced features
```python
def searchin(obj,
             query: str,
             max_depth: int = 3,
             top_k_results: int = 10,
             max_iterable_length: int = 100,
             get_raw_result: bool = False) -> Union[List[SearchResult], None]:
    """
    Search an object for a given search term.
    :param obj: The object to search in.
    :param query: What to search for.
    :param max_depth: The maximum depth of the recursive search.
    :param top_k_results: The maximum number of results to return.
    :param max_iterable_length: The maximum length of an iterable to search in.
    :param get_raw_result: If True, return the raw results (of type SearchResult), else just print them.
    :return: A list of search results.
    """
```

_(Section in english)_  
I want to add a lot of functionnalities to this project, but I don't have much time to work on it. Contributions are welcome!
